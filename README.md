This repository accompanies our manuscript on mixture critical points with the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) Equation of State (EOS).  
It provides reproducible code to calculate:
- Pure compound and multicomponent critical points
- Binary critical loci

Two computational strategies are implemented:
- Newtonâ€“Raphson (NR) formulation of the Heidemann-Khalil (HK) criticality conditions based on PC-SAFT EOS 
- Global Optimization (GO) formulation solved with Differential Evolution (DE) based on PC-SAFT EOS
